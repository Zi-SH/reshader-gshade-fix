# ReShader

A tool to install ReShade on Linux!

**This tool is still work in progress, so expect bugs!**

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cozygalvinism/reshader.git
cd reshader
cargo install --path .
reshader
```

## TODO

* [] Download the fixed shaders and install them into the GShade shaders
* [] Finalize the messages
* [] Clean up the source code
* [] Maybe add support for MacOS?
